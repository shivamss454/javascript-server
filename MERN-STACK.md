# What is MERN Stack?
The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

Here are some examples of widely used web development technology stacks in use today:

    MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
    LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
    MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)


# MERN Stack
MERN stack is a web development framework. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components. Here are the details of what each of these components is used for in developing a web application when using MERN stack:

    **MongoDB:** A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.

    **NodeJS:** The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.

    **ExpressJS:** A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.

    **ReactJS:** A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.
