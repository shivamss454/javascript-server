# five features of vs code editor
**1. Emmet Abbreviations**
These useful shortcuts come built-in to VS Code, and they make writing HTML (and CSS) a lot faster.
Preparing Your HTML File

If you type html in any file, you’ll get a handful of options to fill in the initial data necessary for your file. Navigate through the options by pressing the up or down arrows, then press tab to expand the shortcut.

**2.Adding Tags**

You can quickly create any HTML tags, define their ID, class names, siblings and children by knowing a few quick-to-learn abbreviations.

For example, if you want to create an unordered list with three entries, each with a unique class name, you could type 
**3.Adding Dummy Text**

One of the most useful Emmet abbreviations for web development allows you to insert a chosen amount of dummy text. To insert 100 words, simply write lorem100 and press tab. For 1,000 words, write lorem1000 + tab — and so on.
Emmet for JSX

If you use React’s JSX or another alternative to HTML, you can still use Emmet abbreviations. You just have to enable them manually.

To do that, press CTRL + , to open your settings and click the curly braces symbol {} in the top right corner to open up settings.json . 3. ESLint

ESLint is a powerful and popular linting tool, which helps you spot errors in your code and fix them as you write and which helps you follow common best-practices. It’s also a great learning tool, since researching ESLint errors has taught me many best practices I didn’t know before, and it’s helped me understand why they are best practices.

You can add it as a node package on a per-project basis or you can use the ESLint extension within VS Code. The second option is quick and easy, and it won’t stop you using unique ESLint configurations for particular projects later on. Simply find the ESLint plugin (the one by Dirk Baeumer) and install it.

**4. Prettier**

Prettier is an opinionated code-formatter. It prescribes a certain formatting style as the correct one, but its popularity is making its rules something of an established standard for JavaScript, CSS, and increasing numbers of other languages.

There is overlap between Prettier and ESLint, but ultimately ESLint is more focused on spotting errors and Prettier is more focused on correcting formatting. They work great together, and there’s an integration to help make this as smooth as possible.

The extension we want is “Prettier — Code formatter” by Esben Peterson. To enable the ESLint integration.

**5. Multi-Cursor Shortcuts**

The ability to edit with multiple cursors can be a huge time saver. To use this most effectively requires memorisation of a handful of commands, 

To get the most out of the extension, you’ll likely want a global version of the ESLint library installed on your computer. To do that, ensure you have Node installed. Then open your terminal (if you’re inside VS Code, press CNTRL + ' or CMD + ' ) and

**1.Setting sync**

You should note that Visual Studio Code has a lot of built-in support for many of the widely used plugins or packages found in other editors. 

**2. Shopify Liquid Snippets**

The Shopify Liquid Snippets includes various Liquid snippets to make developing themes faster. This includes snippets for control flow tags, iteration tags, variable tags, array filters, and more. This extension has one dependency, the Liquid Languages Support extension

**3. HTML Snippets**

HTML Snippets adds in rich language support for HTML markup, including snippets, quick info, and descriptions that include whether a tag is deprecated.

**4. Trailing spaces**

The Trailing spaces extension does pretty much what’s in the title, it enables you to highlight trailing spaces and remove them quickly. This extension is a port of the popular Sublime Text plugin Trailing Spaces, and offers quick deletion of trailing spaces, trim on save, and more.

**5. Blank line at end of file**

Blank line at end of file is a minimal and super simple extension that adds an extra blank line at the end of any saved file.

**6. Liquid Languages Support**

The Liquid Languages Support extension is a must have for those developing Shopify themes using VS Code. Though there’s support for sidebar icons to distinguish Liquid files out-of-the-box, VS Code doesn’t have syntax highlighting for Liquid without the help of this extension. This extension adds syntax highlighting for Liquid, and acts as a support for the Shopify Liquid Snippets extension.

**8. ESLint**

This extension integrates ESLint into VS Code, it requires you to already have ESLint installed on your computer: either locally or globally. You can do this with npm, by running npm install -g eslint.
